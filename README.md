K-means Clustering in C
Reads in a data set from a text file, reads in first line as k (# of clusters), n (# of data), d (dimension of data).
Following n lines are d-dimensional data per line.
The programme runs through several interations before the clusters become definite and the program stops.
Output shows the iterations of the program and the sorted clusters in each iteration.
